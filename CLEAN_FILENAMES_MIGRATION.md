# Clean Filenames - Migration Complete ✅

## Changes Made

Successfully cleaned up the project to make HSK 1-3 the default with clean, simple filenames.

### Before (Old Filenames)
```
data/hsk1_2_3_vocabulary.csv/parquet
data/hsk1_2_3_hanzi.csv/parquet
data/hsk1_2_3_components.csv/parquet
```

### After (New Clean Filenames)
```
data/vocabulary.csv/parquet      ← HSK 1-3 vocabulary (2,227 words)
data/hanzi.csv/parquet          ← HSK 1-3 hanzi (899 characters)
data/radicals.csv/parquet       ← HSK 1-3 productive components (233 radicals)
```

## Files Updated

### 1. `generate_hsk_deck.py`
- ✅ Removed `hsk1_2_3` prefix from exported filenames
- ✅ Renamed `components` to `radicals` for consistency
- ✅ Fixed column naming (removed duplicate `usage_count`)
- ✅ Updated title to "TIAN HANZI DECK GENERATOR - HSK 1-3 (Default)"
- ✅ Updated output messages

### 2. `analyze_hsk_components.py`
- ✅ Updated to read from clean filenames
- ✅ Changed `productivity_score` references to `usage_count`
- ✅ Changed `component` references to `radical`
- ✅ All analysis functions working correctly

### 3. `README.md`
- ✅ Updated to show HSK-based generation as default
- ✅ Listed clean output filenames
- ✅ Updated project structure section
- ✅ Emphasized HSK 1-3 as the primary approach

## Data File Format

### vocabulary.csv
```csv
word,hsk_level,frequency_position,pinyin,meaning
的,1,1,de,"of/~'s (possessive particle)..."
我,1,2,wǒ,"I/me/my"
```

### hanzi.csv
```csv
hanzi,pinyin,meaning,components,component_count
一,yī,"one/1/single...",,0
七,qī,"seven/7","乚|一",2
```

### radicals.csv  
```csv
radical,meaning,usage_count
一,one,161
口,mouth,143
丨,line,89
```

## Key Statistics (HSK 1-3)

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| **Vocabulary** | 2,227 words |
| **Hanzi** | 899 characters |
| **Radicals** | 233 productive components |

### Top 5 Radicals by Productivity
1. 一 (one) - 161 character occurrences
2. 口 (mouth) - 143 character occurrences
3. 丨 (line) - 89 character occurrences
4. 丶 (dot) - 51 character occurrences
5. 日 (sun/day) - 49 character occurrences

## Verification Tests

All scripts tested and working:

✅ `python generate_hsk_deck.py` - Generates clean files
✅ `python analyze_hsk_components.py` - Analyzes components correctly
✅ File sizes appropriate:
  - vocabulary.csv: 157 KB
  - hanzi.csv: 75 KB
  - radicals.csv: 3.7 KB

## Benefits of Clean Filenames

1. **Simpler** - No version numbers or prefixes cluttering filenames
2. **Clearer** - Obviously the "current" or "default" version
3. **Compatible** - Matches existing pipeline expectations
4. **Professional** - Clean, production-ready naming
5. **Flexible** - Easy to add versioned variants later if needed

## Next Steps

The data is now ready for:
1. ✅ Dependency-based sorting
2. ✅ Level assignment based on radical/hanzi dependencies
3. ✅ Integration with Anki deck creation
4. ✅ Mnemonic generation based on productive components

## Command Summary

```bash
# Generate HSK 1-3 deck (default)
python generate_hsk_deck.py

# Analyze component productivity
python analyze_hsk_components.py

# Output files (clean names)
ls data/vocabulary.* data/hanzi.* data/radicals.*
```

## Success! 🎉

HSK 1-3 is now the clean, simple default for the Tian Hanzi Deck project.
