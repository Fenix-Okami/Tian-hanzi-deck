## 📋 Overview

This deck teaches Chinese characters by learning components before the characters that use them. Based on HSK 1-3 vocabulary (899 characters, 2,227 words, 233 productive radicals).

### 🎴 Deck Structure

- **233 Radicals** - Component building blocks (brown cards)
- **899 Hanzi** - Characters from HSK 1-3 (green cards)
- **2,227 Vocabulary** - HSK 1-3 words (blue cards)
- **50 Levels** - Sorted by dependencies

### 🎯 Learning Method

Each level teaches components before complex characters:
1. Learn 5 radicals
2. Learn characters that use those radicals
3. Learn words that use those characters

## 🚀 Usage

### Import the Deck

1. Download `anki_deck/HSK_1-3_Hanzi_Deck.apkg`
2. Import into Anki (File → Import)
3. Study cards in order

### Generate from Source

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
bash run_hsk_pipeline.sh
```

Manual steps:
```bash
python generate_hsk_deck.py           # Extract HSK data
python sort_hsk_by_dependencies.py    # Assign dependency levels
python create_hsk_deck.py             # Build Anki deck
```

## � Data Source

The deck extracts all characters from HSK 1-3 vocabulary, then identifies which components appear most frequently. This results in:

- 899 characters (only those used in HSK 1-3 words)
- 2,227 vocabulary entries (complete HSK 1-3 list)
- 233 components (sorted by productivity/usage count)

## 🔄 Dependency System

Cards are organized so components are learned before the characters that use them:

**Level Distribution:**
- Levels 1-47: Radicals (5 per level)
- Levels 2-48: Hanzi (only uses earlier radicals)
- Levels 3-50: Vocabulary (only uses earlier hanzi)

**Example:**
```
Level 1: 一 (one), 口 (mouth), 丨 (line), 丶 (dot)
Level 2: 中 (口 + 丨)
Level 3: 中 (word)
```

**Sort Order:**
Cards within each level are sorted by: Level → HSK tier (1/2/3) → Frequency or component count

## 🎴 Card Layout

### Radical Cards (Brown)
- Front: Component character
- Back: Meaning, usage count, productivity score

### Hanzi Cards (Green)
- Front: Character
- Back: Pinyin, meaning, two mnemonics, components list with meanings

### Vocabulary Cards (Blue)
- Front: Word
- Back: Per-character pinyin (ruby text), meaning, example, character breakdown

**Notes:**
- Surname references removed from meanings, stored as `is_surname` field
- Components shown with meanings: "一 (one), 口 (mouth)"
- Pinyin displayed above each character for vocabulary
