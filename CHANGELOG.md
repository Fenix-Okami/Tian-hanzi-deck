## [0.2.0] - Framework Improvements

### Recent Changes - Separate Mnemonics for Hanzi

### Summary
Split the single `mnemonic` field for Hanzi cards into two separate fields:
- `meaning_mnemonic`: Memory aid for remembering the character's meaning
- `reading_mnemonic`: Memory aid for remembering the character's pronunciation (pinyin)

### Files Modified

1. **create_deck.py**
   - Updated `hanzi_model` fields to include `MeaningMnemonic` and `ReadingMnemonic`
   - Modified card template to display both mnemonics separately with clear labels
   - Updated `create_hanzi_cards()` function to use new field names
   - Updated fallback example data in `get_example_hanzi()`

2. **example_data.py**
   - Updated all HANZI entries to use `meaning_mnemonic` and `reading_mnemonic` fields
   - Added example reading mnemonics that focus on sound/pronunciation aids

3. **validate_data.py**
   - Updated `validate_hanzi()` to check for both new required fields
   - Removed old `mnemonic` field from validation

4. **USAGE.md**
   - Updated Hanzi Fields table to document the two new mnemonic fields
   - Updated card description to mention both meaning and reading mnemonics

5. **README.md**
   - Updated Hanzi data structure documentation
   - Updated code example to show both mnemonic fields

6. **demo.py**
   - Updated Hanzi card display to show both mnemonics separately

### Benefits

- **Clearer Learning**: Separates the cognitive task of learning meaning vs. pronunciation
- **Better Mnemonics**: Allows for specialized memory aids for each aspect
- **More Like WaniKani**: Follows the WaniKani pattern of separate meaning and reading mnemonics
- **Improved Study Flow**: Users can focus on one aspect at a time if needed

### Migration Guide

If you have existing data with a single `mnemonic` field, update your entries to use both fields:

**Before:**
```python
{
    'character': 'äºº',
    'meaning': 'Person',
    'reading': 'rÃ©n',
    'radicals': 'äºº (person)',
    'mnemonic': 'A person standing with legs apart'
}
```

**After:**
```python
{
    'character': 'äºº',
    'meaning': 'Person',
    'reading': 'rÃ©n',
    'radicals': 'äºº (person)',
    'meaning_mnemonic': 'A person standing with two legs spread apart.',
    'reading_mnemonic': 'Sounds like "ren" in "render" - render a person in a drawing!'
}
```

### Testing

All changes have been validated:
- âœ“ Data structure validation passes
- âœ“ Demo script runs successfully
- âœ“ All example data updated with new fields
